## Description of the project

Quizzer is a web application designed to help teachers (at Haaga Helia) create and manage quizzes to support student learning.
The project includes two main web-based dashboards: a teacher dashboard for quiz creation and management, and a student dashboard for quiz-taking and reviews.
The application is accessible through any browser and provides an interactive learning experience for students.

> Acceptable? Add more? If technical implementation details are included, should probably add those after we've discussed and designed our solution.

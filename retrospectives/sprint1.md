[Retrospective board](https://edu.flinga.fi/s/<BOARD_ID>)

Successes:

-We finished the tasks on time and our workflow was in a good pace and our code was easy to read between different team members

Issues:

-We had some issues with github and with the merger of files. We also had some issues with the booting with render. 

Actions:

- We will check that the application is working before submitting the code and to verbalise the errors we received.

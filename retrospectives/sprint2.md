# Sprint 1 Retrospective

[Retrospective board](https://edu.flinga.fi/s/FBUVVUV)

Successes:

-Some of our endpoints worked correctly and there was a responsive chat that helped when needed. The instructions were also very illustrative which was lovely. 

Issues:

-We had some merger problems because my code and the code in viliscode branch were quite difficult.

-We had difficulties sending data from the frontend to the backend.

- There was some exercises that were changed after the exercise was done. which caused some headaches.


Actions:

-Merging into vilis code but as a whole we should merge more often into the main branch.

-
